Whenever I tell people that I am a Tester, they quickly respond with "Oh ... you're a QA." No, I said that I AM A TESTER! 

We all need to get rid of this notion that QAs are the "GATEKEEPERS" of quality on an agile team. In fact, if you're doing it right ... the entire team should be fully aware of the state of the app.
