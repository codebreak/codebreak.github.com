Whenever I tell people that I am a Tester, they quickly respond with "Oh ... you're a QA." No, I said that I'm a TESTER! 

Honestly, I'm not the type to be too concerned about labels. But I definitely think it worth making a distinction just to make a point that Testers are NOT the "GATEKEEPERS" of quality on an agile team. In fact, if you're doing it right ... the entire team should be fully aware of the state of the app.
