Below are examples of what I personally strive for when I'm on an agile project. Do note that the role that a tester plays on a project varies and can depend on the tester or the unique dynamics of the team. 

* Show interest in participating on project **Inceptions** and always accept when invited! 
* Provide tester input when the team is holding their story **Estimation** Sessions.
* Be present in team IPMs ( **Iteration Planning Meetings** ) to gain familiarity with the upcoming stories.
* Pair with the BAs in writing the **Acceptance Criteria** so that missed scenarios can be identified.
* Hold **Story Kickoffs** with a BA and the Developer that has picked up the story.
* **Pair** with Developers in writing their tests. 
* Don't wait till stories are "Ready to Test". Pull the latest and greatest on your local or Test Environment and **start testing early**! (No defects should be created at this time, simply notify the Devs about the issues/concerns found.)
* Once Dev's believe that their stories are "Ready to Test", hold **Desk-checks** with them and a BA to make sure that they've implemented the stories according to the Acceptance Criteria.
* **Automate** functional tests. (Pair with Devs as much as possible when doing this!)
* Perform **Exploratory** Testing on stories and push back stories when blocking issues associated to the stories are found.
* Log **Defects** for issues not blocking stories or those that are new/regression issues.
* Encourage the client to verify stories on Pre-Production and to push to Production as often as possible.
* Perform **Smoke Tests** on the Production Environment.
* Pair with **Dev Ops** to make sure the necessary Environments are created with appropriate data and automated tests.
