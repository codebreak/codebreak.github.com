I've been noticing that the role of a tester has been slowly changing and converging with different roles on an Agile team. Instead of having a strictly defined set of tasks and responsibilities, I've often found my self wearing many different hats on a project. But I guess this only makes sense since collaboration is key in any successful team.

To illustrate my role, I'm going to use the process we followed at my previous project where we specified the status of specific product requirements (which we called "stories") by the following:

#### New 
During the time that stories are being created and broken down by the BAs and Devs, I've always found it useful to be present and provide input from the testers point of view.

#### In Analysis
Once BAs feel like their stories have the essential requirements for the developers, I'll sit and "pair" with them for a bit. And together, we'll go through the stories to make sure that 1. I understand what the stories entail and I am prepared to test
