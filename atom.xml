    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bayareagirlgeekdinners.com/bay-area-girl-geek-dinner-25-sponsored-by-thoughtworks/"><img class="right" src="https://evbdn.eventbrite.com/s3-s3/eventlogos/6471833/screenshot20120828at8.06.17pm.png.jpg" width="200" height="200"></a></p>

<p>After months of planning with my amazing colleagues - <a href="https://twitter.com/AConnJob">Annie Conn</a>, <a href="http://www.bonnachoi.com">Bonna Choi</a>, and <a href="http://www.nanchu.me/">Nancy Chu</a> - we successfully organized the first ever <a href="http://www.bayareagirlgeekdinners.com/bay-area-girl-geek-dinner-25-sponsored-by-thoughtworks/">ThoughtWorks sponsored Girl Geek Dinner.</a></p>

<p>Once the venue, catering, and audio/equipment rentals were confirmed &#8230; the next thing on my list was to find <strong>WOMEN</strong> speakers. Much to my surprise this was the hardest part of the organizing bit! When I thought about who I&#8217;d want to invite to be one of my speakers, I quickly thought of our Chief Technology Officer - <a href="http://join.thoughtworks.com/profiles/rebecca-parsons">Rebecca Parsons</a>. After jotting down Rebecca, I remember having to really think hard about my next set of speaker prospects. Though I eventually came up with 4-5 potential ThoughtWorks women speakers, all of them were out of state! Ideally, I could have flown them in but that&#8217;s not very cost effective especially when each talk would range anywhere from 5-10 mins.</p>

<p>In the end, I decided to look within the ThoughtWorks San Francisco community. By doing so, I was faced with a lot of the same excuses &#8230; <strong>&#8220;I can&#8217;t, I have other plans that day.&#8221;</strong>, <strong>&#8220;I would, but I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;d talk about.&#8221;</strong> and perhaps the most common one of all (which coincidentally was my excuse initially) &#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>I&#8217;ve never done a talk in front of a large audience before and I&#8217;m utterly terrified of speaking in public.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>Where are the women presenters?</p>

<p>Thought about flying people in.
Some had things they wanted to talk about but were too afraid to do the talk. Nervous, no experience.</p>

<p>Tips:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jump at the opportunity</li>
<li>Practice!</li>
<li>Engage the audience.</li>
<li>Speak slowly and annunciate</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t read</li>
<li>Look up</li>
<li>Focus on one person. talk as if you&#8217;re talking to them.</li>
<li>Make it fun!</li>
<li>Use simple slides</li>
<li>include photos</li>
</ul>

    <id>http://codebreak.github.com/blog/2012/07/20/3-years-at-thoughtworks</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over 3 years ago, after being laid off from a start up company then deciding to volunteer in Peru and backpack through South America for a few months - I was basking in the glory of <strong>FUNEMPLOYMENT</strong> when I came across an invitation to a &#8221;<strong>Super Saturday</strong>&#8221; interview event at <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a> - Chicago.</p>

<p>I got flown in and put up at the Club Quarters Hotel in the heart of downtown Chicago. Then during the event, 30-40 candidates got divided into groups and spent the entire day meeting numerous ThoughtWorkers as well participate in various activities like a Lego game and a controversial group discussion.</p>

<blockquote><p>I really appreciated how the main purpose was to not only test my technical abilities but to also determine if I&#8217;m a good culture fit. Never before have I been thoroughly impressed by the way a company hired people.</p></blockquote>

<p>During my 3 year relationship with ThoughtWorks, I have worked on <strong>4 billable projects</strong> as well as numerous side projects in <strong>5 different countries</strong>. I have met countless intellectual co-workers (now friends) from all over the world and I can honestly say that I have learned something from each one of them.</p>

<h2>Assignment in Calgary, Canada (Oct09-March10)</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Role</em>:</strong> Tester</li>
<li><strong><em>Test Stack</em>:</strong> QTP for test automation</li>
<li><strong><em>Learnings</em>:</strong>

<ul>
<li>On my very first project, I had the opportunity to work with a dominantly ThoughtWorks team and learn so much about an array of different roles from amazing people like Jane Robarts (Delivery Assurance and my original sponsor), Mikey Aquilar (Project Coach and my current sponsor), Vijay Seetaram (Iteration Manager), Juanjuan Zang (BA), and Radu Muresan (kick ass DEV).</li>
<li>Within just a few days, it also became apparent that ThoughtWorks is a flat organization and that though there are leads on a project, there is no need to sit around and wait for anyone to tell you what to do. You can (and should) simply just get up and start getting shit done.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><em>Project Status</em>:</strong> ThoughtWorks deemed the project &#8220;successful&#8221; considering we delivered what we said we would - the company division has however been shut down.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Assignment in San Francisco, California (May-Sept10)</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Role</em>:</strong> Mobile Tester</li>
<li><strong><em>Test Stack</em>:</strong> Ruby/RSpec, Cucumber &amp; Frank (iOS)</li>
<li><strong><em>Learnings</em>:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Was lucky enough to be present during the creation of the iOS Test Automation Framework called <a href="http://testingwithfrank.com/">Frank</a> created by fellow ThoughtWorker <a href="http://blog.thepete.net/">Pete Hodgson</a> &amp; Derek Longmuir.</li>
<li>iOS application testing opens up an array of issues that greatly differ from web testing. (More on this later)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><em>Project Status</em>:</strong> Product Successfully launched and is currently one of the top 100 iPad apps in the AppleStore.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Assignment in Melbourne, Australia (Oct10-June11)</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Role</em>:</strong> Tester and Coach</li>
<li><strong><em>Test Stack</em>:</strong> Ruby/RSpec, Cucumber, Capybara &amp; WebDriver</li>
<li><strong><em>Learnings</em>:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Mobile (non-native app) automated tests are easy to write when using the Web Browser. But, manual testing will always need to be done on an actual device which can eventually become cumbersome.</li>
<li>Meticulous implementation/testing is important - however, one should consider being a bit more lenient when dealing with mobile apps where an app&#8217;s average life expectancy is 14 about months.</li>
<li>Learned that consulting is hard and that before you can be taken seriously &#8230; you need to earn the client&#8217;s trust first.</li>
<li>There are defined roles on a project but a role is not meant to be done by one person. The team should work together to fill in each role.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><em>Project Status</em>:</strong> The team successfully delivered the product as specified by the client however, the client had no marketing strategy to move forward and in the end the product was scrapped.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Assignment in Bangalore, India &amp; Xian, China (Aug-Nov11)</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Role</em>:</strong> Coach and Trainer</li>
<li><strong><em>Test Stack</em>:</strong> Python, Django</li>
<li><strong><em>Learnings</em>:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Distributed projects can work so long as you&#8217;re in the same (or close enough) time zone so that can flow back and forth easily.</li>
<li>Make a few changes in your teaching style when english is not the first language of those you are teaching.</li>
<li>Speaking in public is not so hard when you take your time, practice &#8230; and picture the audience is naked &#8230; I mean, interested.</li>
<li>You need to toughen up to survive in China &#8230; speaking the language can&#8217;t hurt either.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><em>Project Status</em>:</strong> 15 new ThoughtWorkers were released to the world and the project we worked on is currently still getting worked on by a team in Pune, India.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Assignment in San Francisco &amp; Los Angeles, California (Dec11-June12)</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Role</em>:</strong> Tester &amp; Business Analyst</li>
<li><strong><em>Test Stack</em>:</strong> Ruby, Cucumber, Capybara, WebDriver &amp; Frank (iOS Testing Tool)</li>
<li><strong><em>Learnings</em>:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Releasing a product SOONER provides feedback and is much more effective than striving for perfection before launching.</li>
<li>Realized the importance of an inception to define some sort of an MVP (Minimal Viable Product).</li>
<li>There needs to be an agreed upon plan to do proper hand over to increase the likelihood that it will be a sustainable project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><em>Project Status</em>:</strong> ThoughtWorks has handed over the working application to the client and we believe implementation is currently still in progress.</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://codebreak.github.com/blog/2012/07/11/firefox-vs-chromedriver/"/>
    <updated>2012-07-11T00:05:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://codebreak.github.com/blog/2012/07/11/firefox-vs-chromedriver</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On my previous project I used Cucumber on top of Capybara to driver out WebDriver. We were initially going to use ChromeDriver instead of the default FireFox &#8230; but I decided at the last minute to stick with Firefox.</p>

<p>Recently, I heard rumors that ChromeDriver is &#8220;Faster&#8221; than Firefox. So, like the curious person that I am, I decided to switch out FireFox for ChromeDriver to test out this claim.</p>

<h3>Setting up Cucumber to use ChromeDriver</h3>

<p>To make the switch, all I had to do was replace the driver definition from:</p>

<pre><code>Capybara.current_driver = :selenium 
</code></pre>

<p>to:</p>

<pre><code>Capybara.register_driver :chrome do |app|
    Capybara::Selenium::Driver.new(app, :browser =&gt; :chrome)
  end
Capybara.javascript_driver = :chrome
</code></pre>

<p>Then in all my Cucumber feature files, I added the tag @javascript:</p>

<h3>Re-run Cucumber Feature Files</h3>

<p>When I re-ran my Cucumber Features files using ChromeDriver, I however came across a few errors:</p>

<pre><code>focusElement execution failed;
   Failed to send keys because cannot focus element (Selenium::WebDriver::Error::UnknownError)
</code></pre>

<blockquote><p>Apparently, You can&#8217;t use send_keys for certain types of inputs. (Workaround - click the element and then use the advanced interactions API to send keys without an element.)</p></blockquote>

<pre><code>Element is not clickable at point (928, 23.5). Other element would receive the click
</code></pre>

<blockquote><p>ChromeDriver always clicks the middle of the element in attempt to be faithful to what an actual user does.
There are two ways to handle this currently:</p>

<ul>
<li>Change/fix the page so that the user can click on the link in the middle.</li>
<li>Use the advanced user interactions API to click at the appropriate place in the link. e.g., ActionChains(w).move_to_element_with_offset(link, 0, 20).click().perform()</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3>Speed Test Results: Firefox vs ChromeDriver</h3>

<p>After fixing the issues above and passing all my tests, I was able to compare their speeds and found that ChromeDriver was 15 - 20% faster than Firefox. With a smaller testsuite, the difference might not make much of a difference but can you imagine the difference on a larger testsuite! In the end &#8230; you have to consider whether Chrome&#8217;s speedy performance is worth dealing with the issues that seem to be ChromeDriver specific.</p>

    <link href="http://codebreak.github.com/blog/2012/06/24/capybara-tutorial-using-irb/"/>
    <updated>2012-06-24T16:03:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://codebreak.github.com/blog/2012/06/24/capybara-tutorial-using-irb</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At one of my previous projects, a fellow ThoughtWorker named Rob Hunter showed me how to use irb (Interactive Ruby Shell) to play around with a test framework for web applications called <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/">Capybara</a>. I&#8217;ve found it pretty useful so I figured I&#8217;d share it here.</p>

<p>To get started, make sure you have ruby installed. (Below I am using ruby version 1.9.2 and creating a gemset using RVM)</p>

<pre><code>rvm use 1.9.2@cucumberplay --create
</code></pre>

<p>Install <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/">Capybara</a> if you haven&#8217;t already.</p>

<pre><code>gem install capybara
</code></pre>

<p>Launch irb with the following requirements (ruby, capybara, and capybara/dsl)</p>

<pre><code>irb -r rubygems -r capybara -r capybara/dsl
</code></pre>

<p>Include Cabybara DSL:</p>

<pre><code>include Capybara::DSL
</code></pre>

<p>Set the default driver.</p>

<pre><code>Capybara.default_driver = :selenium
</code></pre>

<p>Now test that capybara commands work by visiting google</p>

<pre><code>visit "http://www.google.com"
</code></pre>

<h2>Here&#8217;s an example for logging into GMAIL</h2>

<pre><code>visit "http://www.gmail.com"
page.has_content?("A Google approach to email.")

fill_in 'Email', :with =&gt; "johnjames4343@gmail.com"
fill_in 'Passwd', :with =&gt; "johnjames4u"
click_button 'Sign in'
</code></pre>

    <link href="http://codebreak.github.com/blog/2012/06/11/tester-role/"/>
    <updated>2012-06-11T22:54:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://codebreak.github.com/blog/2012/06/11/tester-role</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Below are examples of what I personally strive for when I&#8217;m on an agile project. Do note that the role that a tester plays on a project varies and can depend on the tester or the unique dynamics of the team.</p>

<ul>
<li>Show interest in participating on project <strong>Inceptions</strong> and always accept when invited!</li>
<li>Provide tester input when the team is holding their story <strong>Estimation</strong> Sessions.</li>
<li>Be present in team IPMs ( <strong>Iteration Planning Meetings</strong> ) to gain familiarity with the upcoming stories.</li>
<li>Pair with the BAs in writing the <strong>Acceptance Criteria</strong> so that missed scenarios can be identified.</li>
<li>Hold <strong>Story Kickoffs</strong> with a BA and the Developer that has picked up the story.</li>
<li><strong>Pair</strong> with Developers in writing their tests.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t wait till stories are &#8220;Ready to Test&#8221;. Pull the latest and greatest on your local or Test Environment and <strong>start testing early</strong>! (No defects should be created at this time, simply notify the Devs about the issues/concerns found.)</li>
<li>Once Dev&#8217;s believe that their stories are &#8220;Ready to Test&#8221;, hold <strong>Desk-checks</strong> with them and a BA to make sure that they&#8217;ve implemented the stories according to the Acceptance Criteria.</li>
<li><strong>Automate</strong> functional tests. (Pair with Devs as much as possible when doing this!)</li>
<li>Perform <strong>Exploratory</strong> Testing on stories and push back stories when blocking issues associated to the stories are found.</li>
<li>Log <strong>Defects</strong> for issues not blocking stories or those that are new/regression issues.</li>
<li>Encourage the client to verify stories on Pre-Production and to push to Production as often as possible.</li>
<li>Perform <strong>Smoke Tests</strong> on the Production Environment.</li>
<li>Pair with <strong>Dev Ops</strong> to make sure the necessary Environments are created with appropriate data and automated tests.</li>
</ul>
