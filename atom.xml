    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over 3 years ago, after being laid off from a start up company then deciding to volunteer in Peru and backpack through South America for a few months - I was basking in the glory of <strong>FUNEMPLOYMENT</strong> when I came across an invitation to a &#8221;<strong>Super Saturday</strong>&#8221; interview event at <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a> - Chicago.</p>

<p>I got flown in and put up at the Club Quarters Hotel in the heart of downtown Chicago. Then during the event, 30-40 candidates got divided into groups and spent the entire day meeting numerous ThoughtWorkers as well participate in various activities like a Lego game and a controversial group discussion. I really appreciated how the main purpose was to not only test my technical abilities but to also determine if I&#8217;m a good culture fit.</p>

<blockquote><p>Never before have I been thoroughly impressed by the way a company hired people.</p></blockquote>

<p>During my 3 year relationship with ThoughtWorks, I have worked on <strong>4 billable projects</strong> as well as numerous side projects in <strong>5 different countries</strong>. I have met countless intellectual co-workers (now friends) from all over the world and I can honestly say that I have learned something from each one of them.</p>

<h4>Calgary, Canada Project</h4>

<ul>
<li>I learned quickly that ThoughtWorks is a flat organization and that though there are leads on a project, there is no need to sit around and wait for anyone to tell you what to do. You can (and should) simply just get up and start getting shit done.</li>
<li>Got the chance to use QTP again.</li>
</ul>


<h4>San Francisco, California</h4>

<ul>
<li>First time I got to do some iPad application testing.</li>
<li>Was lucky enough to be present during the creation of the iOS Test Automation Framework called <a href="http://testingwithfrank.com/">Frank</a> created by fellow ThoughtWorker <a href="http://blog.thepete.net/">Pete Hodgson</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Melbourne, Australia</h4>

<ul>
<li>Another Mobile application both generic mobile and Native iOs application</li>
<li>There are defined roles on a project but a role is not meant to be done by one person. The team should work together to fill in that role.</li>
<li>Learned that consulting is hard.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Bangalore, India and Xian, China</h4>

<ul>
<li>Trainer</li>
<li>Getting over my fear of public speaking.</li>
</ul>


<h4>San Francisco, California</h4>

<ul>
<li>Got the opportunity to play the BA role.</li>
<li>Worked closely with DevOps.</li>
<li>Realized the importance of an inception.</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://codebreak.github.com/blog/2012/07/11/firefox-vs-chromedriver/"/>
    <updated>2012-07-11T00:05:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://codebreak.github.com/blog/2012/07/11/firefox-vs-chromedriver</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On my previous project I used Cucumber on top of Capybara to driver out WebDriver. We were initially going to use ChromeDriver instead of the default FireFox &#8230; but I decided at the last minute to stick with Firefox.</p>

<p>Recently, I heard rumors that ChromeDriver is &#8220;Faster&#8221; than Firefox. So, like the curious person that I am, I decided to switch out FireFox for ChromeDriver to test out this claim.</p>

<h3>Setting up Cucumber to use ChromeDriver</h3>

<p>To make the switch, all I had to do was replace the driver definition from:</p>

<pre><code>Capybara.current_driver = :selenium 
</code></pre>

<p>to:</p>

<pre><code>Capybara.register_driver :chrome do |app|
    Capybara::Selenium::Driver.new(app, :browser =&gt; :chrome)
  end
Capybara.javascript_driver = :chrome
</code></pre>

<p>Then in all my Cucumber feature files, I added the tag @javascript:</p>

<h3>Re-run Cucumber Feature Files</h3>

<p>When I re-ran my Cucumber Features files using ChromeDriver, I however came across a few errors:</p>

<pre><code>focusElement execution failed;
   Failed to send keys because cannot focus element (Selenium::WebDriver::Error::UnknownError)
</code></pre>

<blockquote><p>Apparently, You can&#8217;t use send_keys for certain types of inputs. (Workaround - click the element and then use the advanced interactions API to send keys without an element.)</p></blockquote>

<pre><code>Element is not clickable at point (928, 23.5). Other element would receive the click
</code></pre>

<blockquote><p>ChromeDriver always clicks the middle of the element in attempt to be faithful to what an actual user does.
There are two ways to handle this currently:</p>

<ul>
<li>Change/fix the page so that the user can click on the link in the middle.</li>
<li>Use the advanced user interactions API to click at the appropriate place in the link. e.g., ActionChains(w).move_to_element_with_offset(link, 0, 20).click().perform()</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3>Speed Test Results: Firefox vs ChromeDriver</h3>

<p>After fixing the issues above and passing all my tests, I was able to compare their speeds and found that ChromeDriver was 15 - 20% faster than Firefox. With a smaller testsuite, the difference might not make much of a difference but can you imagine the difference on a larger testsuite! In the end &#8230; you have to consider whether Chrome&#8217;s speedy performance is worth dealing with the issues that seem to be ChromeDriver specific.</p>

    <link href="http://codebreak.github.com/blog/2012/06/24/capybara-tutorial-using-irb/"/>
    <updated>2012-06-24T16:03:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://codebreak.github.com/blog/2012/06/24/capybara-tutorial-using-irb</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At one of my previous projects, a fellow ThoughtWorker named Rob Hunter showed me how to use irb (Interactive Ruby Shell) to play around with a test framework for web applications called <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/">Capybara</a>. I&#8217;ve found it pretty useful so I figured I&#8217;d share it here.</p>

<p>To get started, make sure you have ruby installed. (Below I am using ruby version 1.9.2 and creating a gemset using RVM)</p>

<pre><code>rvm use 1.9.2@cucumberplay --create
</code></pre>

<p>Install <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/">Capybara</a> if you haven&#8217;t already.</p>

<pre><code>gem install capybara
</code></pre>

<p>Launch irb with the following requirements (ruby, capybara, and capybara/dsl)</p>

<pre><code>irb -r rubygems -r capybara -r capybara/dsl
</code></pre>

<p>Include Cabybara DSL:</p>

<pre><code>include Capybara::DSL
</code></pre>

<p>Set the default driver.</p>

<pre><code>Capybara.default_driver = :selenium
</code></pre>

<p>Now test that capybara commands work by visiting google</p>

<pre><code>visit "http://www.google.com"
</code></pre>

<h2>Here&#8217;s an example for logging into GMAIL</h2>

<pre><code>visit "http://www.gmail.com"
page.has_content?("A Google approach to email.")

fill_in 'Email', :with =&gt; "johnjames4343@gmail.com"
fill_in 'Passwd', :with =&gt; "johnjames4u"
click_button 'Sign in'
</code></pre>

    <link href="http://codebreak.github.com/blog/2012/06/11/tester-role/"/>
    <updated>2012-06-11T22:54:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://codebreak.github.com/blog/2012/06/11/tester-role</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Below are examples of what I personally strive for when I&#8217;m on an agile project. Do note that the role that a tester plays on a project varies and can depend on the tester or the unique dynamics of the team.</p>

<ul>
<li>Show interest in participating on project <strong>Inceptions</strong> and always accept when invited!</li>
<li>Provide tester input when the team is holding their story <strong>Estimation</strong> Sessions.</li>
<li>Be present in team IPMs ( <strong>Iteration Planning Meetings</strong> ) to gain familiarity with the upcoming stories.</li>
<li>Pair with the BAs in writing the <strong>Acceptance Criteria</strong> so that missed scenarios can be identified.</li>
<li>Hold <strong>Story Kickoffs</strong> with a BA and the Developer that has picked up the story.</li>
<li><strong>Pair</strong> with Developers in writing their tests.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t wait till stories are &#8220;Ready to Test&#8221;. Pull the latest and greatest on your local or Test Environment and <strong>start testing early</strong>! (No defects should be created at this time, simply notify the Devs about the issues/concerns found.)</li>
<li>Once Dev&#8217;s believe that their stories are &#8220;Ready to Test&#8221;, hold <strong>Desk-checks</strong> with them and a BA to make sure that they&#8217;ve implemented the stories according to the Acceptance Criteria.</li>
<li><strong>Automate</strong> functional tests. (Pair with Devs as much as possible when doing this!)</li>
<li>Perform <strong>Exploratory</strong> Testing on stories and push back stories when blocking issues associated to the stories are found.</li>
<li>Log <strong>Defects</strong> for issues not blocking stories or those that are new/regression issues.</li>
<li>Encourage the client to verify stories on Pre-Production and to push to Production as often as possible.</li>
<li>Perform <strong>Smoke Tests</strong> on the Production Environment.</li>
<li>Pair with <strong>Dev Ops</strong> to make sure the necessary Environments are created with appropriate data and automated tests.</li>
</ul>
