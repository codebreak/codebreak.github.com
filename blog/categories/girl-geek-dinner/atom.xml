<p>After months of planning with my amazing colleagues - <a href="https://twitter.com/AConnJob">Annie Conn</a>, <a href="http://www.bonnachoi.com">Bonna Choi</a>, and <a href="http://www.nanchu.me/">Nancy Chu</a> - we successfully organized the first ever <a href="http://www.bayareagirlgeekdinners.com/bay-area-girl-geek-dinner-25-sponsored-by-thoughtworks/">ThoughtWorks sponsored Girl Geek Dinner.</a></p>

<p>Once the venue, catering, and audio/equipment rentals were confirmed ... the next thing on my list was to find <strong>WOMEN</strong> speakers. Much to my surprise this was the hardest part of the organizing bit! When I thought about who I'd want to invite to be one of my speakers, I quickly thought of our Chief Technology Officer - <a href="http://join.thoughtworks.com/profiles/rebecca-parsons">Rebecca Parsons</a>. After jotting down Rebecca, I remember having to really think hard about my next set of speaker prospects. Though I eventually came up with 4-5 potential ThoughtWorks women speakers, all of them were out of state! Ideally, I could have flown them in but that's not very cost effective especially when each talk would range anywhere from 5-10 mins.</p>

<p>In the end, I decided to look within the ThoughtWorks San Francisco community. Aside from the fact that they were out of town the day of the event, many gave me the following excuses:</p>

<ol>
<li>I can't I'm not in town that day.</li>
<li>I don't know what to talk about.</li>
</ol>


<blockquote><p>I've never done a talk in front of a large audience before and I'm utterly terrified of speaking in public.</p></blockquote>

<p>Where are the women presenters?</p>

<p>Thought about flying people in.
Some had things they wanted to talk about but were too afraid to do the talk. Nervous, no experience.</p>

<p>Tips:</p>

<h2>Jump at the opportunity</h2>

<h2>Practice!</h2>

<h2>Engage the audience.</h2>

<h2>Speak slowly and annunciate</h2>

<h2>Don't read</h2>

<h2>Look up</h2>

<h2>Focus on one person. talk as if you're talking to them.</h2>

<h2>Make it fun!</h2>

<h2>Use simple slides</h2>

<h3>include photos</h3>
